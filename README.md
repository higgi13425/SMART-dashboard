# SMART Dashboard Installation

## Step 1: Download Files

   Download all files from repository to local machine. The easiest way to accomplish this is by navigating to the desired location, and using the `git clone` command to clone the repository.

   For example, to navigate to the `Documents` folder on my own local machine, I would open Windows Powershell and enter the following command: 

   `PS:\Users\ntedesco> cd Documents\dashboard\`

   Then, I would clone the repository by running: 

   `git clone https://github.com/ntedesco-umich/SMART-dashboard/`

## Step 2: Install Packages
